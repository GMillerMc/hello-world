# about-me

This is a quick bit about **me**. I'm just getting started in coding and look forward to this journey. 

I love watching and playing football. The best team in London is *chelsea*. 

I love gaming and have a nintendo switch. My favourite consoles I have owned are:-

1. Nintendo 64
2. Playstation 2
3. Nintendo Switch

Music is another passion of mine. I love to listen to it, dance to it, "sing" to it and DJ it.
